This is a  personal schedule of a work day, between the hours of 9AM and 5PM. Tasks or reminders can be entered into each hour of the day and saved into the local storage unit until deleted. Day.JS gives us the day and time the page is opened/refreshed. The time blocks are color coded depending on the time of the work day, whether it's past, present, or future.
